    "Colt rattles off a massive burst of bullets that shoot extra far and destroy cover.",
    "Bull isn't as carefree as he was in his youth, but just because his rowdy days are behind him doesn't mean he won't still crush someone who's asking for it.",
    "Bull's double-barreled shotgun deals heavy damage. It has very short range, so Bull likes to get up close and personal.",
    "Bull puts his head down and bulldozes through opponents and obstacles. He's always been headstrong!",
    "Brock is a smack-talking video game enthusiast. His big attitude hides a more introverted personality, but he'll still do whatever it takes to win!",

    "El Primo is always in the spotlight and that's right where he wants to be! There's no audience he can't win over, except maybe his fellow performers...",
    "El Primo fires off a furious flurry of four fiery fists. That's a spicy jalapeno knuckle sandwich!",
    "Leaping high, El Primo drops an Intergalactic Elbow that knocks around enemies and destroys cover!",

    "Spike lobs a thorny grenade. Enemies caught in the blast area take damage and are slowed down.",
    "A bartending robot designed to mix drinks and banter with patrons, Barley also makes sure to keep his bar clean, to the detriment of anyone who makes a mess.",
    "Barley lobs a bottle, breaking it on the ground. Enemies take damage from the splash, and more damage over time if they stay in the puddle.",
    "Barley hurls a flurry of fiery bottles, covering a huge area in flames. This one's on the house!",
    "Jessie is a prodigy who builds guns and gadgets from parts she finds in the junkyard. Maybe one day her mother Pam will see she can fend for herself!",

    "Nita summons the spirit of Big Baby Bear to hunt down her enemies.",
    "Mortis had grand designs built around being a mortician and a vampire, but the fact that nobody is dying at Starr Park has put a huge damper on his plans.",
    "Mortis dashes forward with a sharp swing of his shovel, creating business opportunities for himself. When he has all three dashes ready, he'll gain a longer dash after a short delay.",
    "Mortis calls forth a swarm of vampire bats that drain the health of enemy Brawlers while restoring his. Creepy!",
    "Crow trusts no one and keeps to himself. The most anyone knows about him is that he's often found at the diner, hanging out with Bull and Bibi.",
    "Crow throws a triple threat of daggers. Enemies hit by the poisoned blades will take damage over time and have all healing effects reduced for the duration.",
    "Crow takes to the skies, throwing a ring of poisoned daggers around him both on take-off and landing.",
    "Poco believes music can change people's lives. He's so enthusiastic about it that he never stops playing, even after people ask him to!",

    "Bo hides explosive traps in the ground. When triggered by an enemy, the traps explode after a short delay, knocking back and damaging enemies.",
    "Bo's Super deploys 5 mines instead of 3. These do not override any mines already placed by his Super, so it is possible to have more than 7 mines on the map!",
    "Piper wants nothing more than to be the local village baker who hands out pies, cookies and other sweet treats! Just don't ask about her past.",
    "Piper fires a sniper shot from the tip of her parasol. The shot gains more oompf the farther it flies!",
    "Piper hops away to avoid pushy suitors. She leaves them a lady's favor though: live grenades from her garter!",

Once you have unlocked all rewards of a certain type, for example Rare Brawlers, the probability to get all other rewards will increase. Luck: In order to make the Brawl Box opening experience fairer, there is a luck system affecting the probability of Legendary Brawlers.

When luck is high enough, you have a higher chance to get a Legendary Brawler, chance will not go higher than <MAX_LEGENDARY>%. Conversely, low luck means that you have a lesser chance to get a new Legendary Brawler. Early draws are predetermined to ensure a fair start for everybody.",
